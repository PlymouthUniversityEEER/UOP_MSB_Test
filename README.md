# Plymouth University Module Support Board Library Test
## An Mbed project to test the features of the libuopmsb library.

The project uses the mbed_app.json file included in the library to allow use of the SD card and I2C bus.


# Usage
Mbed should automatically detect your Nucleo board when it's connected and use the correct pin definitions for the board you are using.
Library dependencies (mbed-os and libuopmsb) need to be included by clicking "fix" in the "Libraries" tab.
Once the libraries have been included the project should build and run as usual.
