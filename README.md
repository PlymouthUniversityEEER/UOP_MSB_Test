# Plymouth University Module Support Board Library Test
## An Mbed project to test the features of the libuopmsb library.

The project uses the mbed_app.json file included in the library to allow use of the SD card and I2C bus.


# Usage
Mbed should automatically detect your Nucleo board when it's connected and use the correct pin definitions for the board you are using.
Library dependencies (mbed-os and libuopmsb) need to be included by clicking "fix" in the "Libraries" tab.
Once the libraries have been included the project should build and run as usual.

Further information regarding usage of the library can be found in the libraries Readme.md file
